# Lumberjacky

Do you ever get the squiggly line with eslint that specifies to not use console.log? I do, but instead of completely
turning off the rule, or forgo any console logging, what if we have a SOLID, dependency injectable, logging framework
useful for both frontend and backend? What if we have a logging framework that uses an abstraction around logging so you
can log in one manner and have your logs sent everywhere you need? This is what Lumberjacky is for.
